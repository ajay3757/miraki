        issuing a valid ticket (a ticket that will be accepted by the bus operator) for its network of bus operators;

        A copy of the ticket (a printout of the ticket or the printout of the ticket email).

        Refund policy mentioned on the ticket is indicative. The actual cancellation charges are determined by bus operators and bus providers at the actual time of cancellation. T-Wallet has no role in governing the cancellation charges.
        Cancellation charges are calculated on the actual fare of the ticket. If any discount coupons are used while purchasing the ticket, the discounted value would be used to calculate the refund amount when a ticket is canceled.
        In case a booking confirmation e mail and SMS gets delayed or fails because of technical reasons or as a result of incorrect e mail ID/phone number provided by the user, etc., a ticket will be considered ‘booked’ as long as the ticket shows up on the confirmation page of the T-Wallet Platform.
        Amenities on the buses as shown on T-Wallet have been configured and provided by the bus service provider (bus operator). These amenities will be provided unless there are some exceptions on certain days. Please note that T-Wallet provides this information in good faith to help passengers to make an informed decision. Provision of video, air conditioning and any such other services mentioned by T-Wallet’s travel partners in the buses is their own responsibility. Any refunds/claims due to non-functioning or unavailability of these services needs to be settled directly with the bus service provider.
        T-Wallet is not responsible for any kind of journey inconvenience, injury or death, caused during the journey or flowing from the journey.
