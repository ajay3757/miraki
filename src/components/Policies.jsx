<h2> CITIZEN GRIEVANCE </h2>
<h3>  Citizen Grievance Policy</h3>
<h6>     T Wallet is launched by Telangana State government. This wallet is co-branded and hosted by Transaction Analysts (TA) who is RBI licensed PPI operator. The objective of this policy is to minimize instances of citizen complaints to ensure prompt redressal of various types of citizen complaints.

  The Government of Telangana (GoT) understands the importance of citizen service which should be prompt and complete in all respects. To achieve this, we have taken adequate measures which allow our citizens to reach us in multiple ways. We ensure that all citizen grievances are recorded and respective complaint number is given to citizen for future follow ups. TA has developed Grievances Handling System (GHS) to track each and every grievance raised by the citizen. Our processes are designed keeping the following in mind:

  Citizens are to be treated fairly at all times.
  Citizens are fully informed of avenues to escalate their complaints / grievances within the organization and their rights to alternative remedy, if they are not fully satisfied with the response to their complaints.
  Complaints made by citizens are dealt promptly and with compassion.
  We will address all complaints efficiently and fairly and the interest of the citizen will be foremost.

<h6> ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GRIEVANCES
  Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) is simple as citizens have to provide only mobile number and transaction number. Each complaint is assigned and identified by a unique complaint number
  Any grievance received through any of the above channels will be recorded.
  The actions taken to address the complaints would be communicated to citizens through notifications for online (desktop / laptop) users and mobile app users. Feature phone and no phone users can get updates by reaching the call center number provided in this document.
  We may contact the citizens if additional information is required for effective resolution of their complaints provided citizen has email id or mobile number.
  Citizens can track the status of their complaints with the unique complaint number.
